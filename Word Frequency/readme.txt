
1) word_freq.py - Counts the number of times that each word shows up in all the posts in the file

2) Assignment-1.py - The solution to the problem descibed below.

Problem:
- Write a script that reads the 'data' file that we used in class and finds the word with the highest frequency in the file. 

- Print the word on the screen.

- If more than 1 words have the highest frequency, then print any of the these words. For example, if both 'house' and 'room' appear 3 times, and 3 is the highest frequency of any word in the file, then you can print either one of the two words.

- We are interested in word frequency within the posts. In other words, ignore the first two columns of the file (user, day) and focus on the last one, just like we did in class.

- We are interested in the overall frequency of each term. In other words, if a word appears twice in the same post, its frequency should be increased by 2.
